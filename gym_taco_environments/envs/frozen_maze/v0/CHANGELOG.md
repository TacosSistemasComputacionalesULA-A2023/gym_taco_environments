## [main]

-The main branch contains the Frozen Maze env which is a randomized version of the Frozen Lake env.

-For changing the dimensions of the grid please go to the settings.py file and change the ROWS and COLS constants. 

-If you want to make the tiles bigger in your screen please change the H_SCALE and V_SCALE constants for a bigger value in the settings.py file.

-If you want the maze to change its form you can change the SEED constant in the settings.py file.

-Please remember that each time you change a value in the settings.py file you'll have to uninstall and install again the gym_taco_environments lib into your project again.
